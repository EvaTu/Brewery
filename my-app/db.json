They established Woodland and captured the essence of Brew Central, America’s Craft Brew Destination. As a brewer, Redhead strives to create new vibrant and tasty beers regularly! If you love one of their beers when you stop in and drink up! It might not be back again! Barrel aged beers and cask ales are two of the main focuses at Woodland. With two beer engines, there are always two cask offerings at any time! Their casks rotate regularly and offer variations and concoctions of whats on tap; each with a little twist. Some times with more hops in the cask, maybe even local coffee or even cocoa. Ain't nothing gonna stop them from throwing in some hot peppers, peanut butter, or fruit from time to time, too!"
